# 🐾 VetCare – Veterinary Appointment Booking System

## 📌 Overview
VetCare is a full-stack veterinary appointment booking application developed to streamline how pet owners connect with veterinary professionals. The platform offers seamless booking, appointment management, and communication between pet owners and doctors.

##  Motivation
Growing up in a rural area, I personally witnessed how the lack of timely veterinary care leads to loss of livestock — especially cows and buffaloes, which are a major source of livelihood in many villages. According to reports, **over 1 lakh cattle deaths occur annually in India** due to unavailability of veterinary doctors and poor healthcare tracking systems. 

This inspired me to build VetCare — a tech-based solution that could bridge this gap by making veterinary services accessible online.
